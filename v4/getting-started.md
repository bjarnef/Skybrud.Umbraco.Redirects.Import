This pacakge adds two new extra options to the **Add new redirect** button.

The new **Import** option opens a new overlay that lets you import a CSV, XLSX or JSON file with the redirects that you wish to import. The **Export** option opens a similar overlay, but for exporting existing redirects to a file in one of the mentioned formats.
